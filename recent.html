            <p class="slide-definition">
              As climate change intensifies, wildfires have become more frequent and devastating. To combat this growing threat, Dryad Networks introduces Silvaguard, an AI-driven drone designed to accelerate wildfire detection, location tracking, and real-time monitoring. Silvaguard operates alongside Silvanet, Dryad’s solar-powered gas sensor network that detects wildfires at the smoldering stage. Once Silvanet identifies a fire, it triggers a nearby Silvaguard drone to autonomously fly to the location, capturing infrared and optical video for precise situational awareness. Key Features:
              Autonomous AI-Driven Flight – Responds instantly to fire detection signals<br>
              Infrared & Optical Imaging – Provides real-time visual data to firefighters<br>
              Wireless Integration with Silvanet – Enhances early warning capabilities<br>
              Scalable & Efficient – Covers vast forested areas with minimal human intervention<br>
              During a live demonstration in Eberswalde, Germany, the first Silvaguard prototype successfully detected and monitored a controlled fire, showcasing its speed and accuracy.

              Researchers at Nagoya University have unveiled the world’s smallest shooting game, using nanoscale technology to manipulate real-world particles with high-speed electron beams. This innovative project demonstrates Nano-Mixed Reality (Nano-MR), a new interface where digital and physical nano-objects interact in real time. Joystick-Controlled Electron Beam: Moves a virtual spaceship across a nanoscale battlefield; Nano-Sized Enemy Targets: Polystyrene nanoparticles act as in-game enemies; Real-Time Interaction: The electron beam generates force fields that push nano-objects on command. This breakthrough isn’t just for fun—the same technology could revolutionize biomedical engineering and nanotechnology. Potential applications include:
              Advanced 3D Printing: Real-time nanoscale object manipulation<br>
              Targeted Drug Delivery: Guiding toxic agents to virus cells with precision<br>
